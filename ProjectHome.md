OSCurato controller is being developed to offer vjs/performers/djs a quick, cheap controller made with Arduino.

OSCurato was part of the "Arduino meets Resolume" workshop kept during the "live performers meeting" 2010 in Rome, by Davide Gomba a.k.a. Allume and Alberto Massa a.k.a. Kobon.

The controller is based on the HD encoder sketch from Cristian Maglie <c.maglie@bug.st>, who is available under GPL 2.0

We have to thank Massimo Banzi for some parts of the Firmata Code multiplexing analog inputs.

## Part List ##
(for version 0.1)

**8 potentiometers**8 buttons
**8 10KOms resistors**1 4051 analog multiplexer
**1 Hacked Hard Disk (4 pinned)**

## Hard Disk ##

Open an broken Hard Disk following this instructable from [nvillar](nvillar.md)
http://www.instructables.com/id/HDDJ-Turning-an-old-hard-disk-drive-into-a-rotary/

Our code works for a four pinned (most common) Hard Disk.
Nvillar worked on a three pinned Hard Disk.

## Multiplexing ##

the multiplexing part is using this playground page

## The Circuit ##

soon a treu schematic ;)
